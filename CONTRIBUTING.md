## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Ensure that tests are created for changes to the codebase, and that all tests pass.
3. Address any linting errors that may arise appropriately, with as few `noqa`s as possible.
4. Adhere to the project style guidelines whenever possible. One may stray from these guidelines 
when readability or functionality is negatively effected.
5. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
6. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
7. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

community;
 - Keep reviews, comments, and issues informative, yet respectful
 - Do not spam mentions in pull requests or issues
 - Do your own research; this helps prevent fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD)
 - Opinions are welcome, but please remain open to those of others
